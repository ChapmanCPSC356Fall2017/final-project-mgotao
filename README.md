# Currency Exchange Rate App - Android Application Development Fall 2017

Final project for Android App Dev.

This app allows you to view all available currencies listed on the European Central bank and provides the user with their exchange rates.
When viewing a certian currency, the user will be able to convert an amount of their choosing to another currency. The user will then be
able to see the current exchange rate (updated every morning via open-source API fixer.io), the converted amount, and the exchange rates
from the start of 2015, 2016, and 2017.

Resources used:

Fixer - lightweight API to get exchange rates, either latest or any historical date from the start of 1999.

Android Country Flags - free resource of every country's flag used for each country's cell on the List.
